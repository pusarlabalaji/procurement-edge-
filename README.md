Overview

    Procurement Edge is a procurement intelligence and lead-generation project for Indian SMB manufacturing and F&B. It combines supplier benchmarks (price bands, lead times, defect rates), total landed cost calculators, compliance flags, and a supplier-paid RFQ lead exchange.

Key Features

    Supplier intelligence: benchmarks on price bands, lead times, defect rates

    Landed cost calculators: total cost with duties, freight, fees

    Compliance flags and supplier performance signals (anonymized)

    Lead exchange: buyers use free tools; suppliers purchase qualified RFQs

    ERP/MM connectors for anonymized PO/GRN uploads and auto-benchmarking
    
Architecture

    Frontend: Wix (Velo/Studio)

    Backend/Logic: Velo code and integrations (planned connectors to ERP/MM exports)

    Data: Scraped public catalogs/tenders/logistics quotes + user-submitted POs/GRNs (anonymized)
